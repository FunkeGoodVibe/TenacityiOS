Being A Parent App for NHS Clinical Psychologist Client 

This project began January 2018. 
We presented the completed project to our client at the end of March 2018. 

This github does not contain the code history, and the Kanban board used for communication cannot be viewed as this project was completed on a separate github account. 

    Please download Dr Josh Video Tutorial 
    
For a very, very general overview how the app works.
